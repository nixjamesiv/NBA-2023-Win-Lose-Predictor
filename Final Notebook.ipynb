    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This project centered around a model that predicts the outcome of the NBA's next season. 205 Sports Solutions was founded in order to help NBA teams have a better idea of their future by the numbers in order to know what to expect with their future and thus set out the correct long term plan for success. In order to create our model we use data based on [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/stats/player/_/season/2001/seasontype/2/table/offensive/sort/avgPoints/dir/desc), [nba.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/boxscores/?Season=2021-22&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) and [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/) from the 2001 to the 2022 NBA seasons and analyzed 1,821 games during that span. We used player rankings and expirence from pre-season and season games to determine the points that each team scored in a post-season game to determine the winner of that game."

    "## Data Understanding\n",
    "\n",
    "The data sets we used to create our models came from an [ESPN](https://www.espn.com/nba/stats/player/_/season/2001/seasontype/2/table/offensive/sort/avgPoints/dir/desc) database, [nba.com](https://www.nba.com/stats/teams/boxscores/?Season=2021-22&SeasonType=Regular%20Season) and data from [Basketball-Reference.com](https://www.basketball-reference.com/teams/). The data included 1,821 games from seasons between 2011-2022. We then combined the 3 data sets by player ranking, team, and game data which combined the player and team data sets which then allowed for the player rank to be next to each player and then we found each team in the game data sets and added in the player rankings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Thus, we used player ranking for a given position to determine the points that that team will score againnst another team. Our model uses player ranking to predict a games scores since ranking is based on the number of points a player scores on average for each game. Thus, ranking is a great predictor for post season games points since ranking is based on points scored in season games prior to the post season games. This means that overall our dataframe has 3642 rows and 43 columns. \n"
