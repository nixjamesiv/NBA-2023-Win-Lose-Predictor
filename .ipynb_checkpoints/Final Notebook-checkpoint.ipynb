    "This project is centered around a model that predicts the outcome of the NBA's next season. 205 Sports Solutions was founded in order to help NBA teams have a better idea of their future by the numbers in order to know what to expect with their future and thus set out the correct long term plan for success. In order to create our model we use data based on ESPN and Basketball-Reference.com from the 2001 to the 2022 NBA seasons and analyzed 1,821 games during that span."
